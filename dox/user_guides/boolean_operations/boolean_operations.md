@section occt_algorithms_1 Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive description of the Boolean Operation Algorithm (BOA) as it is  implemented in Open CASCADE Technology. The Boolean Component contains:

* General Fuse Operator (GFA), 
* Boolean Operator (BOA), 
* Section Operator (SA), 
* Partition Operator (PA). 

GFA is the base algorithm for BOA, PA, SA.

GFA has a history-based architecture designed to allow using OCAF naming functionality. The architecture of GFA is expandable, that allows creating new algorithms basing on it.


@section occt_algorithms_2 Overview 

@subsection occt_algorithms_2_1 Operators

@subsubsection occt_algorithms_2_1_1 Boolean operator

The Boolean operator provides the operations (Common, Fuse, Cut) between two groups: *Objects* and *Tools*. Each group consists of an arbitrary number of arguments in terms of *TopoDS_Shape*.

The operator can be represented as:

<i>R<sub>B</sub>=B<sub>j</sub> (G<sub>1</sub>, G<sub>2</sub>),</i>	

where:
* *R<sub>B</sub>* -- result of the operation;
* *B<sub>j</sub>* -- operation of type *j* (Common, Fuse, Cut);
* *G<sub>1</sub>={S<sub>11</sub>, S<sub>12</sub> ... S<sub>1n1</sub>}*  group of arguments (Objects); 
* *G<sub>2</sub>={S<sub>21</sub>, S<sub>22</sub> ... S<sub>2n2</sub>}*  group of arguments (Tools);
* *n<sub>1</sub>* -- Number of arguments in *Objects* group; 
* *n<sub>2</sub>* -- Number of arguments in *Tools* group.


**Note** There is an operation *Cut21*, which is an extension for forward Cut operation, i.e <i>Cut21=Cut(G2, G1)</i>.

@subsubsection occt_algorithms_2_1_2 General Fuse operator

The General fuse operator can be applied to an arbitrary number of arguments in terms of *TopoDS_Shape*.

The GFA operator can be represented as:

<i>R<sub>GF</sub> = GF (S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub> ... S<sub>n</sub>), </i>	

where
* *R<sub>GF</sub>* -- result of the operation,
* *S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub> ... S<sub>n</sub>* -- arguments of the operation,
* *n* -- number of arguments.

The result of the Boolean operator, *R<sub>B</sub>*, can be obtained from *R<sub>GF</sub>*.

For example, for two arguments *S<sub>1</sub>* and *S<sub>2</sub>* the result *R<sub>GF</sub>* is

<i>R<sub>GF</sub> = GF (S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>) = S<sub>p1</sub> + S<sub>p2</sub> + S<sub>p12</sub></i>	

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image001.svg,  "Operators"}

This Figure shows that 
* <i>B<sub>common</sub> (S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>) = S<sub>p12</sub>;</i>
* <i>B<sub>cut12</sub> (S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>) = S<sub>p1</sub>;</i>
* <i>B<sub>cut21</sub> (S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>) = S<sub>p2</sub>;</i>
* <i>B<sub>fuse</sub> (S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>) = S<sub>p1</sub>+S<sub>p2</sub>+S<sub>p12</sub></i>

<i>R<sub>GF</sub>=GF (S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>) = B<sub>fuse</sub> = B<sub>common</sub>+ B<sub>cut12</sub>+ B<sub>cut21</sub>.</i>

The fact that *R<sub>GF</sub>* contains the components of *R<sub>B</sub>* allows considering GFA as the general case of BOA. So it is possible to implement BOA as a subclass of GFA.

@subsubsection occt_algorithms_2_1_3 Partition operator 

The Partition operator can be applied to an arbitrary number of arguments in terms of *TopoDS_Shape*. The arguments are divided on two groups: Objects, Tools. The result of PA contains all parts belonging to the Objects but does not contain the parts that belongs to the Tools only.

The PA operator can be represented as follows:

<i>R<sub>PA</sub>=PA (G<sub>1</sub>, G<sub>2</sub>),</i>
where:
* <i>R<sub>PA</sub></i> -- is the result of the operation; 
* *G<sub>1</sub>={S<sub>11</sub>, S<sub>12</sub> ... S<sub>1n1</sub>}*  group of arguments (Objects); 
* *G<sub>2</sub>={S<sub>21</sub>, S<sub>22</sub> ... S<sub>2n2</sub>}*  group of arguments (Tools);
* *n<sub>1</sub>* -- Number of arguments in *Objects* group; 
* *n<sub>2</sub>* -- Number of arguments in *Tools* group.

The result *R<sub>PA</sub>* can be obtained from *R<sub>GF</sub>* .

For example, for two arguments *S<sub>1</sub>* and  *S<sub>2</sub>* the result *R<sub>PA</sub>* is

<i>R<sub>PA</sub>=PA(S<sub>1</sub>,S<sub>2</sub>)=S<sub>p1</sub>+S<sub>p12</sub>.</i>      

In case when all arguments of the PA are Objects (no Tools), the result of PA is equivalent to the result of GFA. 

For example, when *G<sub>1</sub>* consists of shapes *S<sub>1</sub>* and *S<sub>2</sub>* the result of  *R<sub>PA</sub>* is

<i>R<sub>PA</sub>=PA(S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>) = S<sub>p1</sub> + S<sub>p2</sub> + S<sub>p12</sub> = GF (S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>)</i>

The fact that the *R<sub>GF</sub>* contains the components of *R<sub>PA</sub>* allows considering GFA as the general case of PA. Thus, it is possible to implement PA as a subclass of GFA.


@subsubsection occt_algorithms_2_1_4 Section operator

The Section operator *SA* can be applied to arbitrary number of arguments in terms of *TopoDS_Shape*. The result of *SA* contains vertices and edges in accordance with interferences between the arguments 
The SA operator can be represented as follows:
<i>R<sub>SA</sub>=SA(S1, S2â€¦ Sn)</i>, where
* <i>R<sub>SA</sub></i> -- the operation result;
* <i>S1, S2 ... Sn</i> -- the operation arguments;
* *n* -- the number of arguments.

@subsection occt_algorithms_2_2 Parts of algorithms 

GFA, BOA, PA and SA have the same Data Structure (DS). The main goal of the Data Structure is to store all necessary information for input data and intermediate results.

The operators consist of two main parts:
*	Intersection Part (IP). The main goal of IP is to compute the interferences between sub-shapes of arguments. The IP uses DS to retrieve input data and store the results of intersections.
*	Building Part (BP). The main goal of BP is to build required result of an operation. This part also uses DS to retrieve data and store the results.

As it follows from the definition of operator results, the main differences between GFA, BOA, PA and SA are in the Building Part. The Intersection Part is the same for the algorithms.

@section occt_algorithms_3 Terms and Definitions

This chapter provides the background terms and definitions that are necessary to understand how the algorithms work. 

@subsection occt_algorithms_3_1 Interferences

There are two groups of interferences.

At first, each shape having a boundary representation (vertex, edge, face) has an internal value of geometrical tolerance. The shapes interfere with each other in terms of their tolerances. The shapes that have a boundary representation interfere when there is a part of 3D space where the distance between the underlying geometry of shapes is less or equal to the sum of tolerances of the shapes. Three types of shapes: vertex, edge and face -- produce six types of **BRep interferences:**
* Vertex/Vertex,
* Vertex/Edge,
* Vertex/Face,
* Edge/Edge, 
* Edge/Face and 
* Face/Face.

At second, there are interferences that occur between a solid *Z1* and a shape *S2* when *Z1* and *S2* have no BRep interferences but *S2* is completely inside of *Z1*. These interferences are **Non-BRep interferences**. There are four possible cases:
* Vertex/Solid, 
* Edge/Solid, 
* Face/Solid and 
* Solid/Solid.

@subsubsection occt_algorithms_3_1_1 Vertex/Vertex interference

For two vertices *Vi* and *Vj*, the distance between their corresponding 3D points is less than the sum of their tolerances *Tol(Vi)* and *Tol(Vj)*.

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image002.svg,  "Vertex/vertex interference"}

The result is a new vertex *Vn* with 3D point *Pn* and tolerance value <i>Tol(Vn)</i>. 

The coordinates of *Pn* and the value <i>Tol(Vn)</i> are computed as the center and the radius of the sphere enclosing the tolerance spheres of the source vertices <i>(V1, V2)</i>.

@subsubsection occt_algorithms_3_1_2	Vertex/Edge interference

For a vertex *Vi* and an edge *Ej*, the distance *D* between 3D point of the vertex and its projection on the 3D curve of edge *Ej* is less or equal than sum of tolerances of vertex *Tol(Vi)* and edge *Tol(Ej)*.

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image003.svg,  "Vertex/edge interference"}

The result is vertex *Vi* with the corresponding tolerance value <i>Tol(Vi)=Max(Tol(Vi), D+Tol(Ej))</i>, where <i>D = distance (Pi, PPi)</i>; 

and parameter *t<sub>i</sub>* of the projected point *PPi* on 3D curve *Cj* of edge *Ej*.

@subsubsection occt_algorithms_3_1_3	Vertex/Face interference

For a vertex *Vi* and a face *Fj* the distance *D* between 3D point of the vertex and its projection on the surface of the face is less or equal than sum of tolerances of the vertex *Tol(Vi)* and the face *Tol(Fj)*. 

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image004.svg,  "Vertex/face interference"}

The result is vertex *Vi* with the corresponding tolerance value <i>Tol(Vi)=Max(Tol(Vi), D+Tol(Fj))</i>, where <i>D = distance (Pi, PPi)</i>

and parameters <i>u<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>i</sub></i> of the projected point *PPi* on surface *Sj* of face *Fj*.

@subsubsection occt_algorithms_3_1_4	Edge/Edge interference

For two edges *Ei* and *Ej* (with the corresponding 3D curves *Ci* and *Cj*) there are some places where the distance between the curves is less than (or equal to) sum of tolerances of the edges. 

Let us examine two cases:

In  the first case two edges have one or several common parts of 3D curves in terms of tolerance.

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image005.svg,  "Edge/edge interference: common parts"}

The results are: 
* Parametric range <i>[t<sub>i1</sub>, t<sub>i2</sub> ]</i> for 3D curve *Ci* of edge *Ei*.
* Parametric range <i>[t<sub>j1</sub>, t<sub>j2</sub> ]</i> for 3D curve *Cj* of edge *Ej*. 

In the second case two edges have one or several common points in terms of tolerance.

@image html /user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image006.svg  "Edge/edge interference: common points"
@image latex /user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image006.svg  "Edge/edge interference: common points"

The result is a new vertex *Vn* with 3D point *Pn* and tolerance value *Tol(Vn)*.

The coordinates of *Pn* and the value *Tol(Vn)* are computed as the center and the radius of the sphere enclosing the tolerance spheres of the corresponding nearest points *Pi*, *Pj* of 3D curves *Ci*, *Cj* of source edges *Ei*, *Ej*. 

* Parameter *t<sub>i</sub>* of *Pi* for the 3D curve *Ci*.
* Parameter *t<sub>j</sub>* of *Pj* for the 3D curve *Cj*.

@subsubsection occt_algorithms_3_1_5	Edge/Face interference

For an edge *Ei* (with the corresponding 3D curve *Ci*) and a face *Fj* (with the corresponding 3D surface *Sj*) there are some places in 3D space, where the distance between *Ci* and surface *Sj* is less than (or equal to) the sum of tolerances of edge *Ei* and face *Fj*.

Let us examine two cases:

In the first case Edge *Ei* and Face *Fj* have one or several common parts in terms of tolerance. 

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image007.svg, "Edge/face interference: common parts"}

The result is a parametric range <i>[t<sub>i1</sub>, t<sub>i2</sub>]</i> for the 3D curve *Ci* of the edge *Ei*.

In the second case Edge *Ei* and Face *Fj* have one or several common points in terms of tolerance.

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image008.svg,  "Edge/face interference: common points"}

The result is a new vertex *Vn* with 3D point *Pn* and tolerance value *Tol(Vn)*. 

The coordinates of *Pn* and the value *Tol(Vn)* are computed as the center and the radius of the sphere enclosing the tolerance spheres of the corresponding nearest points *Pi*, *Pj* of 3D curve *Ci* and surface *Sj* of source edges *Ei*, *Fj*.

*	Parameter *t<sub>i</sub>* of *Pi* for the 3D curve *Ci*.
*	Parameters *u<sub>i</sub>* and *v<sub>i</sub>* of the projected point *PPi* on the surface *Sj* of the face *Fj*.

@subsubsection occt_algorithms_3_1_6	Face/Face Interference

For a face *Fi* and a face *Fj* (with the corresponding surfaces *Si* and *Sj*) there are some places in 3D space, where the distance between the surfaces is less than (or equal to) sum of tolerances of the faces.

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image009.svg,  "Face/face interference: common curves"}

In the first case the result contains intersection curves *C<sub>ijk</sub> (k = 0, 1, 2â€¦k<sub>N</sub>,* where *k<sub>N</sub>* is the number of intersection curves with corresponding values of tolerances *Tol(C<sub>ijk</sub>)*.

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image010.svg, "Face/face interference: common points"}

In the second case Face *Fi* and face *Fj* have one or several new vertices *V<sub>ijm</sub>*, where <i>m=0,1,2, ... mN, mN </i> is the number of intersection points.

The coordinates of a 3D point *P<sub>ijm</sub>* and the value *Tol(V<sub>ijm</sub>)* are computed as the center and the radius of the sphere enclosing the tolerance spheres of the corresponding nearest points *Pi*, *Pj* of the surface *Si*, *Sj* of source shapes *Fi*, *Fj*.

* Parameters *u<sub>j</sub>*, *v<sub>j</sub>* belong to point *PPj* projected on surface *Sj* of face *Fj*.
* Parameters *u<sub>i</sub>* and *v<sub>i</sub>* belong to point *PPi* projected on surface *Si* of face *Fi*. 

@subsubsection occt_algorithms_3_1_7	Vertex/Solid Interference

For a vertex *Vi* and a solid *Zj* there is Vertex/Solid interference if the vertex *Vi* has no BRep interferences with any sub-shape of *Zj* and *Vi* is completely inside the solid *Zj*.

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image060.png,  "Vertex/Solid Interference"}

@subsubsection occt_algorithms_3_1_8 Edge/Soild Interference

For an edge *Ei* and a solid *Zj* there is Edge/Solid interference if the edge *Ei* and its sub-shapes have no BRep interferences with any sub-shape of *Zj* and *Ei* is completely inside the solid *Zj*.

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image061.png,  "Edge/Solid Interference"}

@subsubsection occt_algorithms_3_1_9 Face/Soild Interference

For a face *Fi* and a solid *Zj* there is Face/Solid interference if the face *Fi* and its sub-shapes have no BRep interferences with any sub-shape of *Zj* and *Fi* is completely inside the solid *Zj*. 

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image062.png,  "Face/Solid Interference"} 

@subsubsection occt_algorithms_3_1_10  Solid/Soild Interference

For a solid *Zi* and a solid *Zj* there is Solid/Solid interference if the solid *Zi* and its sub-shapes have no BRep interferences with any sub-shape of *Zj* and *Zi* is completely inside the solid *Zj*. 

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image063.png,  "Solid/Solid Interference"} 


@subsubsection occt_algorithms_3_1_11 Computation Order

The interferences between shapes are computed on the basis of increasing of the dimension value of the shape in the following order: 
* Vertex/Vertex, 
* Vertex/Edge, 
* Edge/Edge, 
* Vertex/Face, 
* Edge/Face, 
* Face/Face, 
* Vertex/Solid,
* Edge/Solid,
* Face/Solid,
* Solid/Solid.

This order allows avoiding the computation of redundant interferences between upper-level shapes *Si* and  *Sj* when there are interferences between lower sub-shapes *Sik* and *Sjm*.

@subsubsection occt_algorithms_3_1_12	Results

* The result of the interference is a shape that can be either interfered shape itself (or its part) or a new shape.
* The result of the interference is a shape with the dimension value that is less or equal to the minimal dimension value of interfered shapes. For example, the result of Vertex/Edge interference is a vertex, but not an edge.
* The result of the interference splits the source shapes on the parts each time as it can do that.

@subsection occt_algorithms_3_2	Paves

The result of interferences of the type Vertex/Edge, Edge/Edge and Edge/Face in most cases is a vertex (new or old) lying on an edge.

The result of interferences of the type Face/Face in most cases is intersection curves, which go through some vertices lying on the faces.

The position of vertex *Vi* on curve *C* can be defined by a value of parameter <i>t<sub>i</sub></i> of the 3D point of the vertex on the curve.
Pave *PVi* on curve *C* is a structure containing the vertex *Vi* and correspondent value of the parameter  <i>t<sub>i</sub></i> of the 3D point of the vertex on the curve. Curve *C* can be a 3D or a 2D curve.

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image011.svg,  "Paves"}

Two paves *PV1* and *PV2* on the same curve *C* can be compared using the parameter value @code PV1 > PV2 if t1 > t2 @endcode  

The usage of paves allows binding of the vertex to the curve (or any structure that contains a curve: edge, intersection curve).


@subsection occt_algorithms_3_3	Pave Blocks

A set of paves *PVi (i=1, 2...nPV)*, where *nPV* is the number of paves] of curve *C* can be sorted in the increasing order using the value of parameter *t* on curve *C*.

A pave block *PBi* is a part of the object (edge, intersection curve) between neighboring paves. 

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image012.svg, "Pave Blocks"}

Any finite source edge *E* has at least one pave block that contains two paves *PVb* and *PVe*:
* Pave *PVb* corresponds to the vertex *Vb* with minimal parameter <i>t<sub>b</sub></i> on the curve of the edge.
* Pave *PVe* corresponds to the vertex *Ve* with maximal parameter <i>t<sub>e</sub></i> on the curve of the edge.

@subsection occt_algorithms_3_4 Shrunk Range

Pave block *PV* of curve *C* is bounded by vertices *V1* and *V2* with tolerance values *Tol(V1)* and *Tol(V2)*. Curve *C* has its own tolerance value *Tol(C)*:
* In case of edge, the tolerance value is the tolerance of the edge.
* In case of intersection curve, the tolerance value is obtained from an intersection algorithm.

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image013.svg, "Shrunk Range"}

The theoretical parametric range of the pave block is <i>[t1C, t2C]</i>.

The positions of the vertices *V1* and *V2* of the pave block can be different. The positions are determined by the following conditions:
~~~~
Distance (P1, P1c) is equal or less than Tol(V1) + Tol(C)
Distance (P2, P2c) is equal or less than Tol(V2) + Tol(C)
~~~~
The Figure shows that each tolerance sphere of a vertex can reduce the parametric range of the pave block to a range <i>[t1S, t2S]</i>. The range <i>[t1S, t2S]</i> is the shrunk range of the pave block. 

The shrunk range of the pave block is the part of 3D curve that can interfere with other shapes.

@subsection occt_algorithms_3_5 Common Blocks

The interferences of the type Edge/Edge, Edge/Face produce results as common parts.

In case of Edge/Edge interference the common parts are pave blocks that have different base edges. 

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image014.svg, "Common Blocks: Edge/Edge interference"}

If the pave blocks <i>PB<sub>1</sub>, PB<sub>2</sub>â€¦PB<sub>NbPB</sub></i> , where *NbPB* is the number of pave blocks have the same bounding vertices and geometrically coincide, the pave blocks form common block *CB*.
	

In case of Edge/Face interference the common parts are pave blocks lying on a face(s).

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image015.svg, "Common Blocks: Edge/Face interference"}

If the pave blocks *PBi* geometrically coincide with a face *Fj*, the pave blocks form common block *CB*.

In general case a common block *CB* contains:
* Pave blocks *PBi (i=0,1,2, 3â€¦ NbPB)*.
* A set of faces *Fj (j=0,1... NbF), NbF* -- number of faces.


@subsection occt_algorithms_3_6 FaceInfo

The structure *FaceInfo* contains the following information:
* Pave blocks that have state **In** for the face;
* Vertices that have state **In** for the face;
* Pave blocks that have state **On** for the face;
* Vertices that have state **On** for the face;
* Pave blocks built up from intersection curves for the face;
* Vertices built up from intersection points for the face.

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image016.svg,  "Face Info"}

In the figure, for face *F1*:
* Pave blocks that have state **In** for the face: *PB<sub>in1</sub>*.
* Vertices that have state **In** for the face: *V<sub>in1</sub>*.
* Pave blocks that have state **On** for the face: *PB<sub>on11</sub>*,  *PB<sub>on12</sub>*, *PB<sub>on2</sub>*, *PB<sub>on31</sub>*, *PB<sub>on32</sub>*, *PB<sub>on4</sub>*.
* Vertices that have state **On** for the face: *V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6*.
* Pave blocks built up from intersection curves for the face: *PB<sub>sc1</sub>*.
* Vertices built up from intersection points for the face: none


@section occt_algorithms_4 Data Structure

Data Structure (DS) is used to:
* Store information about input data and intermediate results;
* Provide the access to the information;
* Provide the links between the chunks of information.

This information includes:
* Arguments;
* Shapes;
* Interferences;
* Pave Blocks;
* Common Blocks.

Data Structure is implemented in the class *BOPDS_DS*.

@subsection occt_algorithms_4_1	Arguments

The arguments are shapes (in terms of *TopoDS_Shape*):
* Number of arguments is unlimited.
* Each argument is a valid shape (in terms of *BRepCheck_Analyzer*).
* Each argument can be of one of the following types (see the Table):

| No	| Type	| Index of Type |
| :----- | :----- | :----- |

| 7	| EDGE	| 6 | 
| 8	| VERTEX | 7 | 

* The argument of type *0 (COMPOUND)* can include any number of shapes of an arbitrary type (0, 1â€¦7).
* The argument should not be self-interfered, i.e. all sub-shapes of the argument that have geometrical coincidence through any topological entities (vertices, edges, faces) must share these entities.
* There are no restrictions on the type of underlying geometry of the shapes. The faces or edges of arguments *S<sub>i</sub>* can have underlying geometry of any type supported by Open CASCADE Technology modeling algorithms (in terms of *GeomAbs_CurveType* and *GeomAbs_SurfaceType*). 
* The faces or edges of the arguments should have underlying geometry with continuity that is not less than C1.

@section occt_algorithms_9	Boolean Operations Algorithm

@subsection occt_algorithms_9_1	Arguments

* The arguments of BOA are shapes in terms of *TopoDS_Shape*. The main requirements for the arguments are described in the @ref occt_algorithms_4 "Data Structure"
* There are two groups of arguments in BOA:
	* Objects <i>(S1=S11, S12, ...)</i>;
	* Tools <i>(S2=S21, S22, ...)</i>.
* The following table contains the values of dimension for different types of arguments:

| No | Type of Argument	| Index of Type | Dimension |
| :---- | :---- | :----- | :---- |
| 1 | COMPOUND | 0 | One of 0, 1, 2, 3 |
| 2	| COMPSOLID	| 1	| 3 |
| 3	| SOLID	| 2	| 3 |
| 4	| SHELL	| 3	| 2 |
| 5	| FACE | 4 | 2 |
| 6	| WIRE | 5 | 1 |
| 7 | EDGE | 6 | 1 |
| 8 | VERTEX | 7 | 0 |

* For Boolean operation Fuse all arguments should have equal dimensions.
* For Boolean operation Cut the minimal dimension of *S2* should not be less than the maximal dimension of *S1*.
* For Boolean operation Common the arguments can have any dimension.

@subsection occt_algorithms_9_3	Results. General Rules

* The result of the Boolean operation is a compound (if defined). Each sub-shape of the compound has shared sub-shapes in accordance with interferences between the arguments. 
* The content of the result depends on the type of the operation (Common, Fuse, Cut12, Cut21) and the dimensions of the arguments. 
* The result of the operation Fuse is defined for arguments *S1* and *S2* that have the same dimension value : *Dim(S1)=Dim(S2)*. If the arguments have different dimension values the result of the operation Fuse is not defined. The dimension of the result is equal to the dimension of the arguments. For example, it is impossible to fuse an edge and a face.
* The result of the operation Fuse for arguments *S1* and *S2* contains the parts of arguments that have states **OUT** relative to the opposite arguments.
* The result of the operation Fuse for arguments *S1* and *S2* having dimension value 3 (Solids) is refined by removing all possible internal faces to provide minimal number of solids.
* The result of the operation Common for arguments *S1* and *S2* is defined for all values of the dimensions of the arguments. The result can contain shapes of different dimensions, but the minimal dimension of the result will be equal to the minimal dimension of the arguments. For example, the result of the operation Common between edges cannot be a vertex. 
* The result of the operation Common for the arguments *S1* and *S2* contains the parts of the argument that have states **IN** and **ON** relative to the opposite argument.
* The result of the operation Cut is defined for arguments *S1* and *S2* that have values of dimensions *Dim(S2)* that should not be less than *Dim(S1)*. The result can contain shapes of different dimensions, but the minimal dimension of the result will be equal to the minimal dimension of the objects *Dim(S1)*. The result of the operation *Cut12* is not defined for other cases. For example, it is impossible to cut an edge from a solid, because a solid without an edge is not defined. 
* The result of the operation *Cut12* for arguments *S1* and *S2* contains the parts of argument *S1* that have state **OUT** relative to the opposite argument *S2*.
* The result of the operation *Cut21* for arguments *S1* and *S2* contains the parts of argument *S2* that have state **OUT** relative to the opposite argument *S1*.
* For the arguments of collection type (WIRE, SHELL, COMPSOLID) the type will be passed in the result. For example, the result of Common operation between Shell and Wire will be a compound containing Wire.
* For the arguments of collection type (WIRE, SHELL, COMPSOLID) containing overlapping parts the overlapping parts passed into result will be repeated for each container from the input shapes containing such parts.
* The result of the operation Fuse for the arguments of collection type (WIRE, SHELL, COMPSOLID) will contain the same number of containers as the arguments. The overlapping parts (EDGES/FACES/SOLIDS) will be shared among them. For example, the result of Fuse operation between two wires will be two wires sharing coinciding edges if any.
* The result of the operation Common for the arguments of collection type (WIRE, SHELL, COMPSOLID) will consist of the containers containing the same overlapping parts. For example, the result of Common operation between two fully/partially overlapping wires will be two wires containing the same edges.

@section occt_algorithms_10	Algorithm Limitations 

The chapter describes the problems that are considered as Algorithm limitations. In most cases an Algorithm failure is caused by a combination of various factors, such as self-interfered arguments, inappropriate or ungrounded values of the argument tolerances, adverse mutual position of the arguments, tangency, etc.

A lot of failures of GFA algorithm can be caused by bugs in low-level algorithms: Intersection Algorithm, Projection Algorithm, Approximation Algorithm, Classification Algorithm, etc.
* The Intersection, Projection and Approximation Algorithms are mostly used at the Intersection step. Their bugs directly cause wrong section results (i.e. incorrect section edges, section points, missing section edges or micro edges). It is not possible to obtain a correct final result of the GFA if a section result is wrong.
* The Projection Algorithm is used at the Intersection step. The purpose of Projection Algorithm is to compute 2D curves on surfaces. Wrong results here lead to incorrect or missing faces in the final GFA result. 
* The Classification Algorithm is used at the Building step. The bugs in the Classification Algorithm lead to errors in selecting shape parts (edges, faces, solids) and ultimately to a wrong final GFA result.

The description below illustrates some known GFA limitations. It does not enumerate exhaustively all problems that can arise in practice. Please, address cases of Algorithm failure to the OCCT Maintenance Service.


@subsection occt_algorithms_10_1	Arguments

@subsubsection occt_algorithms_10_1_1	Common requirements 

Each argument should be valid (in terms of *BRepCheck_Analyzer*), or conversely, if the argument is considered as non-valid (in terms of *BRepCheck_Analyzer*), it cannot be used as an argument of the algorithm.

The class *BRepCheck_Analyzer* is used to check the overall validity of a shape. In OCCT a Shape (or its sub-shapes) is considered valid if it meets certain criteria. If the shape is found as invalid, it can be fixed by tools from *ShapeAnalysis, ShapeUpgrade* and *ShapeFix* packages.

However, it is important to note that class *BRepCheck_Analyzer* is just a tool that can have its own problems; this means that due to a specific factor(s) this tool can sometimes provide a wrong result.

Let us consider the following example:

The Analyzer checks distances between couples of 3D check-points <i>(Pi, PSi)</i> of edge *E* on face *F*. Point *Pi* is obtained from the 3D curve (at the parameter *ti*) of the edge. *PSi* is obtained from 2D curve (at the parameter *ti*) of the edge on surface *S* of face *F*. To be valid the distance should be less than *Tol(E)* for all couples of check-points. The number of these check-points is a predefined value (e.g. 23). 

Let us consider the case when edge *E* is recognized valid (in terms of *BRepCheck_Analyzer*).

Further, after some operation, edge *E* is split into two edges *E1* and *E2*. Each split edge has the same 3D curve and 2D curve as the original edge *E*. 

Let us check *E1* (or E2). The Analyzer again checks the distances between the couples of check-points points <i>(Pi, PSi)</i>. The number of these check-points is the same constant value (23), but there is no guarantee that the distances will be less than *Tol(E)*, because the points chosen for *E1* are not the same as for *E*. 

Thus, if *E1* is recognized by the Analyzer as non-valid, edge *E*  should also be non-valid. However *E* has been recognized as valid. Thus the Analyzer gives a wrong result for *E*.

The fact that the argument is a valid shape (in terms of *BRepCheck_Analyzer*) is a necessary but insufficient requirement to produce a valid result of the Algorithms.

@subsubsection occt_algorithms_10_1_3	Pure self-interference

The argument should not be self-interfered, i.e. all sub-shapes of the argument that have geometrical coincidence through any topological entities (vertices, edges, faces) should share these entities.

#### Example 1: Compound of two edges
The compound of two edges *E1* and *E2* is a self-interfered shape and cannot be used as the argument of the Algorithms.

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image036.svg, "Compound of two edges"}

#### Example 2: Self-interfered Edge
The edge *E* is a self-interfered shape and cannot be used as an argument of the Algorithms.

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image037.svg, "Self-interfered Edge"}
 
#### Example 3: Self-interfered Face
The face *F* is a self-interfered shape and cannot be used as an argument of the Algorithms.

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image038.svg, "Self-interfered Face"}
 
####	Example 4: Face of Revolution
The face *F* has been obtained by revolution of edge *E* around line *L*.

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image039a.png, "Face of Revolution: Arguments"} 
@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image039b.png, "Face of Revolution: Result"} 

In spite of the fact that face *F* is valid (in terms of *BRepCheck_Analyzer*) it is a self-interfered shape and cannot be used as the argument of the Algorithms.

@subsubsection occt_algorithms_10_1_4	Self-interferences due to tolerances
#### Example 1: Non-closed Edge

Let us consider edge *E* based on a non-closed circle. @figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image040.png, "Edge based on a non-closed circle"}

The distance between the vertices of *E* is *D=0.69799*. The values of the tolerances *Tol(V1)=Tol(V2)=0.5*.
@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image041.png,  "Distance and Tolerances"}
 
In spite of the fact that the edge *E* is valid in terms of *BRepCheck_Analyzer*, it is a self-interfered shape because its vertices are interfered. Thus, edge *E* cannot be used as an argument of the Algorithms.

#### Example 2: Solid containing an interfered vertex

Let us consider solid *S* containing vertex V. @figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image042.png,  "Solid containing an interfered vertex"}

The value of  tolerance Tol(V)= 50.000075982061.

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image043.png,  "Tolerance"}

In spite of the fact that solid *S* is valid in terms of *BRepCheck_Analyzer* it is a self-interfered shape because vertex *V* is interfered with a lot of sub-shapes from *S* without any topological connection with them. Thus solid *S* cannot be used as an argument of the Algorithms.

@subsubsection occt_algorithms_10_1_5 Parametric representation
The parameterization of some surfaces (cylinder, cone, surface of revolution) can be the cause of limitation.

####	Example 1: Cylindrical surface
The parameterization range for cylindrical surface is:

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/boolean_image135.png}

The range of *U* coordinate is always restricted while the range of *V* coordinate is non-restricted.

Let us consider a cylinder-based *Face 1* with radii *R=3* and *H=6*. 

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image044.png, "Face 1"}

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image045.png, "P-Curves for Face 1"}

Let us also consider a cylinder-based *Face 2* with radii *R=3000* and *H=6000* (resulting from scaling Face 1 with scale factor *ScF=1000*). 

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image046.png, "Face 2"}

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image047.png, "P-Curves for Face 2"}

Please, pay attention to the Zoom value of the Figures.

It is obvious that starting with some value of *ScF*, e.g. *ScF>1000000*, all sloped p-Curves on *Face 2*  will be almost vertical. At least, there will be no difference between the values of angles computed by standard C Run-Time Library functions, such as *double acos(double x)*. The loss of accuracy in computation of angles can cause failure of some BP sub-algorithms, such as building faces from a set of edges or building solids from a set of faces.


@subsubsection occt_algorithms_10_1_6 Using tolerances of vertices to fix gaps

It is possible to create shapes that use sub-shapes of lower order to avoid gaps in the tolerance-based data model.

Let us consider the following example:

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image048.png, "Example"}

* Face *F* has two edges *E1* and *E2* and two vertices, the base plane is <i>{0,0,0, 0,0,1}</i>;
* Edge *E1* is based on line <i>{0,0,0, 1,0,0}, Tol(E1) = 1.e-7; </i>
* Edge *E2* is based on line <i>{0,1,0, 1,0,0}, Tol(E2) = 1.e-7;</i>
* Vertex *V1*, point <i>{0,0.5,0}, Tol(V1) = 1;</i>
* Vertex *V2*, point <i>{10,0.5,0}, Tol(V2) = 1;</i>
* Face *F* is valid (in terms of *BRepCheck_Analyzer*).
 
The values of tolerances *Tol(V1)* and *Tol(V2)* are big enough to fix the gaps between the ends of the edges, but the vertices *V1* and *V2* do not contain any information about the trajectories connecting the corresponding ends of the edges. Thus, the trajectories are undefined. This will cause failure of some sub-algorithms of BP. For example, the sub-algorithms for building faces from a set of edges use the information about all edges connected in a vertex. The situation when a vertex has several pairs of edges such as above will not be solved in a right way. 


@subsection occt_algorithms_11_1	Intersection problems
@subsubsection occt_algorithms_11_1_1 Pure intersections and common zones 

#### Example: Intersecting Edges

Let us consider the intersection between two edges:
* *E1* is based on a line: <i>{0,-10,0, 1,0,0}, Tol(E1)=2.</i>
* *E2* is based on a circle: <i>{0,0,0, 0,0,1}, R=10, Tol(E2)=2.</i>

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image049.png, "Intersecting Edges"} 

The result of pure intersection between *E1* and *E2* is vertex *Vx {0,-10,0}*.

The result of intersection taking into account tolerances is the common zone *CZ* (part of 3D-space where the distance between the curves is less than or equals to the sum of edge tolerances. 

The Intersection Part of Algorithms uses the result of pure intersection *Vx* instead of *CZ* for the following reasons: 
* The Algorithms do not produce Common Blocks between edges based on underlying curves of explicitly different type (e.g. Line / Circle). If the curves have different types, the rule of thumb is that the produced result is of type **vertex**. This rule does not work for non-analytic curves (Bezier, B-Spline) and their combinations with analytic curves.
* The algorithm of intersection between two surfaces *IntPatch_Intersection* does not compute *CZ* of the intersection between curves and points. So even if *CZ* were computed by Edge/Edge intersection algorithm, its result could not be treated by Face/Face intersection algorithm.

@subsubsection occt_algorithms_11_2_2 Tolerances and inaccuracies

The following limitations result from modeling errors or inaccuracies.

#### Example: Intersection of planar faces

Let us consider two planar rectangular faces *F1* and *F2*.

The intersection curve between the planes is curve *C12*. The curve produces a new intersection edge *EC12*. The edge goes through vertices *V1* and *V2* thanks to big tolerance values of vertices *Tol(V1)* and *Tol(V2)*. So, two straight edges *E12* and *EC12* go through two vertices, which is  impossible in this case.

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image050.svg, "Intersecting Faces"} 


The problem cannot be solved in general, because the length of *E12* can be infinite and the values of *Tol(V1)* and *Tol(V2)* theoretically can be infinite too.

In a particular case the problem can be solved in several ways:
* Reduce, if possible, the values of *Tol(V1)* and *Tol(V2)* (refinement of *F1*).
* Analyze the value of *Tol(EC12)* and increase *Tol(EC12)* to get a common part between the edges *EC12* and *E12*. Then the common part will be rejected as there is an already existing edge *E12* for face *F1*.

It is easy to see that if *C12* is slightly above the tolerance spheres of *V1* and *V2* the problem does not appear. 

#### Example: Intersection of two edges

Let us consider two edges *E1* and *E2*, which have common vertices *V1* and *V2*. The edges *E1* and *E2* have 3D-curves *C1* and *C2. Tol(E1)=1.e<sup>-7</sup>, Tol(E2)=1.e<sup>-7</sup>.*

*C1* practically coincides in 3D with *C2*. The value of deflection is *Dmax* (e.g. *Dmax=1.e<sup>-6</sup>*). 

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image051.svg, "Intersecting Edges"} 

The evident and prospective result should be the Common Block between *E1* and *E2*. However, the result of intersection differs. 

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image052.svg, "Result of Intersection"} 

The result contains three new vertices *Vx1, Vx2* and *Vx3*, 8 new edges <i>(V1, Vx1, Vx2, Vx3, V2)</i> and no Common Blocks. This is correct due to the source data: *Tol(E1)=1.e<sup>-7</sup>, Tol(E2)=1.e<sup>-7</sup>* and <i>Dmax=1.e<sup>-6</sup></i>.

In this particular case the problem can be solved by several ways:
* Increase, if possible, the values *Tol(E1)* and *Tol(E2)* to get coincidence in 3D between *E1* and *E2* in terms of tolerance.
* Replace *E1* by a more accurate model.

The example can be extended from 1D (edges) to 2D (faces).

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image053.svg, "Intersecting Faces"} 

The comments and recommendations are the same as for 1D case above.


@subsubsection occt_algorithms_11_2_3 Acquired Self-interferences
####	Example 1: Vertex and edge

Let us consider vertex *V1* and edge *E2*. 

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image054.svg, "Vertex and Edge"} 

Vertex *V1* interferes with vertices *V12* and *V22*.
So vertex *V21* should interfere with vertex *V22*, which is impossible because vertices *V21* and *V22* are the vertices of edge *E2*, thus *V21* is not equal to *V22*.

The problem cannot be solved in general, because the length can be as small as possible to provide validity of *E2* (in the extreme case: *Length (E2) = Tol(V21) + Tol(V22) + e,* where *e-> 0*).

In a particular case the problem can be solved by refinement of arguments, i.e. by decreasing the values of *Tol(V21)*, *Tol(V22)* and  *Tol(V1)*.

#### Example 2: Vertex and wire
  
Let us consider vertex *V2* and wire consisting of edges *E11* and *E12*. 

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/operations_image055.svg, "Vertex and Wire"} 

The arguments themselves are not self-intersected.
Vertex *V2* interferes with edges *E11* and *E12*. Thus, edge *E11* should interfere with edge *E22*, but it is impossible because edges *E11* and *E12* cannot interfere by the condition.
 
The cases when a non-self-interfered argument (or its sub-shapes) become interfered due to the intersections with other arguments (or their sub-shapes) are considered as limitations for the Algorithms.

@section occt_algorithms_11a Advanced Options

The previous chapters describe so called Basic Operations. Most of tasks can be solved using Basic Operations. Nonetheless, there are cases that can not be solved straightforwardly by Basic Operations. The tasks are considered as limitations of Basic Operations. 

The chapter is devoted to Advanced Options. In some cases the usage of Advanced Options allows overcoming the limitations, improving the quality of the result of operations, robustness and performance of the operators themselves.

@subsection occt_algorithms_11a_1  Fuzzy Boolean Operation

Fuzzy Boolean operation is the option of Basic Operations (GFA, BOA, PA and SA), in which additional user-specified tolerance is used. This option allows operators to handle robustly cases of touching and near-coincident, misalignment entities of the arguments.

The Fuzzy option is useful on the shapes with gaps or embeddings between the entities of these shapes which are not covered by the tolerance values of these entities. Such shapes can be the result of modeling mistakes, or translating process, or import from other systems with loss of precision, or errors in some algorithms. 

Most likely, the Basic Operations will give unsatisfactory results on such models. The result may contain unexpected and unwanted small entities, faulty entities (in terms of *BRepCheck_Analyzer*), or there can be no result at all.

With the Fuzzy option it is possible to get the expected result -- it is just necessary to define the appropriate value of fuzzy tolerance for the operation. To define that value it is necessary to measure the value of the gap (or the value of embedding depth) between the entities of the models, slightly increase it (to make the shifted entities coincident in terms of their tolerance plus the additional one) and pass it to the algorithm.

Fuzzy option is included in interface of Intersection Part (class *BOPAlgo_PaveFiller*) and application programming interface (class  *BRepAlgoAPI_BooleanOperation*)

@subsection occt_algorithms_11a_2 Examples
The following examples demonstrate the advantages of usage Fuzzy option operations over the Basic Operations in typical situations.

@subsubsection occt_algorithms_11a_1_1 Case 1

In this example the cylinder (shown in yellow and transparent) is subtracted from the box (shown in red). The cylinder is shifted by  5e<sup>-5</sup> relatively to the box along its axis (the distance between rear faces of the box and cylinder is 5e<sup>-5</sup>).

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/boolean_image121.png} 
  
The following results are obtained using Basic Operations and the Fuzzy ones with the fuzzy value 5e<sup>-5</sup>:

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/boolean_image122.png, "Result of CUT operation obtained with Basic Operations"} 

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/boolean_image123.png, "Result of CUT operation obtained with Fuzzy Option"} 

In this example Fuzzy option allows eliminating a very thin part of the result shape produced by Basic algorithm due to misalignment of rear faces of the box and the cylinder. 

@subsubsection occt_algorithms_11a_1_2 Case 2

In this example two boxes are fused. One of them has dimensions 10*10*10, and the other is 10*10.000001*10.000001 and adjacent to the first one. There is no gap in this case as the surfaces of the neighboring faces coincide, but one box is slightly greater than the other. 

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/boolean_image124.png} 

The following results are obtained using Basic Operations and the Fuzzy ones with the fuzzy value 1e<sup>-6</sup>: 

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/boolean_image125.png, "Result of CUT operation obtained with Basic Operations"} 

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/boolean_image126.png, "Result of CUT operation obtained with Fuzzy Option"} 

In this example Fuzzy option allows eliminating an extremely narrow face in the result produced by Basic operation.

@subsubsection occt_algorithms_11a_1_3 Case 3

In this example the small planar face (shown in orange) is subtracted from the big one (shown in yellow). There is a gap 1e<sup>-5</sup> between the edges of these faces.

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/boolean_image127.png} 

The following results are obtained using Basic Operations and the Fuzzy ones with the fuzzy value 1e<sup>-5</sup>: 

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/boolean_image128.png, "Result of CUT operation obtained with Basic Operations"} 

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/boolean_image129.png, "Result of CUT operation obtained with Fuzzy Option"} 

In this example Fuzzy options eliminated a pin-like protrusion resulting from the gap between edges of the argument faces.

@subsubsection occt_algorithms_11a_1_4 Case 4

In this example the small edge is subtracted from the big one. The edges are overlapping not precisely, with max deviation between them equal to 5.28004e<sup>-5</sup>. We will use 6e<sup>-5</sup> value for Fuzzy option.

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/boolean_image130.png} 

The following results are obtained using Basic Operations and the Fuzzy ones with the fuzzy value 6e<sup>-5</sup>: 

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/boolean_image131.png, "Result of CUT operation obtained with Basic Operations"} 

@figure{/user_guides/boolean_operations/images/boolean_image132.png, "Result of CUT operation obtained with Fuzzy Option"} 

This example stresses not only the validity, but also the performance issue. The usage of Fuzzy option with the appropriate value allows processing the case much faster than with the pure Basic operation. The performance gain for the case is 45 (Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3450 CPU @ 3.10 GHz).
